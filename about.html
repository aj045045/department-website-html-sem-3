            <p>Department of Computer Science, Gujarat University is the most popular, well sought and best resourced
                Computer Science
                Department in Gujarat. Ever since its inception, Department of Computer Science has maintained and sustained
                its legacy
                as a premium institute in providing high quality education to produce personnel with professional and
                personal success
                as well as high ethics and social conduct. The resources at the department are well supported by extensive
                networked
                Computer facilities and software aids well along with skilled and experienced faculties. A pioneer institute
                in initiating
                and successfully running MCA and PGDCSA since 1982, the Department initiated M.Tech.(Networking and
                Administration) ,
            M.Tech.(Web Technologies) and PGDNA in 2010. The aim of initiating these programs is to produce
            professionals ready to meet
            the current market needs as well as skilled in research capabilities. Understanding that Intelligent
            Computing is the future
            of computing, the department initiated yet another post graduate course in Intelligent Computing. The course
            M.Sc.
            (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning) aims to provide M.Sc. degree in Artificial Intelligence and
            Machine Learning.
            This program offers a solid awareness of the key concepts of Artificial Intelligence. The students would be
            able to develop
            strong basis of machine learning and data mining. The students would have best career prospects in
            scientific, business and
            financial sectors. Further to leverage the versatile system to train Computer professionals department has
            started 5 Year
            Integrated M. Sc. (Computer Science) in 2021. To promote and facilitate research in Computer Science and
            other interdisciplinary
            subjects, Department offers doctoral courses like Ph.D. (Computer science) under well-experienced guides.
            The Department also
            takes the responsibility to the fullest of training the educators. It has organized in recent past UGC short
            courses and
            international workshops imparting theoretical and practical training to various colleges and universities
            teachers at state level and national level.</p>
