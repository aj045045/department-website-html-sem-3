        <p>Department of Computer Science, Gujarat University is the most popular, well sought and best resourced Computer Science 
            Department in Gujarat. Ever since its inception, Department of Computer Science has maintained and sustained its legacy 
            as a premium institute in providing high quality education to produce personnel with professional and personal success 
            as well as high ethics and social conduct. The resources at the department are well supported by extensive networked 
            Computer facilities and software aids well along with skilled and experienced faculties. A pioneer institute in initiating
            and successfully running MCA and PGDCSA since 1982, the Department initiated M.Tech.(Networking and Administration) ,
            M.Tech.(Web Technologies) and PGDNA in 2010. The aim of initiating these programs is to produce professionals ready to meet 
            the current market needs as well as skilled in research capabilities. Understanding that Intelligent Computing is the future 
            of computing, the department initiated yet another post graduate course in Intelligent Computing. The course M.Sc. 
            (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning) aims to provide M.Sc. degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
            This program offers a solid awareness of the key concepts of Artificial Intelligence. The students would be able to develop 
            strong basis of machine learning and data mining. The students would have best career prospects in scientific, business and
            financial sectors. Further to leverage the versatile system to train Computer professionals department has started 5 Year 
            Integrated M. Sc. (Computer Science) in 2021. To promote and facilitate research in Computer Science and other interdisciplinary
            subjects, Department offers doctoral courses like Ph.D. (Computer science) under well-experienced guides. The Department also 
            takes the responsibility to the fullest of training the educators. It has organized in recent past UGC short courses and 
            international workshops imparting theoretical and practical training to various colleges and universities 
            teachers at state level and national level.</p>
